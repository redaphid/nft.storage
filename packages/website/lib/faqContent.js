      NFT.Storage helps NFT developers today who are looking for easy APIs and
      best practices for storing their NFT data securely and resiliently. Even
      in the short-term, it is a trustless and decentralized solution. Users are
      able to cryptographically verify that the{' '}

      that the service provides corresponds to their data, and that this data is
      hosted in multiple ways across the IPFS and Filecoin networks (allowing
      for accessibility across the network and preventing lock-in, with users
      also able to pin their data elsewhere to increase redundance).
      <br />
      <br />
      Though we believe that there will always be value in some form of the
      libraries and services NFT.Storage provides, in the long-term the goal is
      to increasingly decentralize NFT.Storage. This includes relying more
      directly on the Filecoin network as the protocol continues to evolve. Some
      examples include storing data directly on the Filecoin network without
      putting it on a centralized IPFS node first and building oracles + DAOs +
      bridges to ensure n copies of data on the network (as Filecoin continues
      to evolve). We also want to make it easy for users to deploy and run their
      own NFT.Storage storage service. This, and other exciting things on the
      horizon, will help upgrade {"today's"} NFT.Storage implementation into the
      provably permanent storage solutions of tomorrow.

  httpGatewayError: (

      Not necessarily! HTTP gateways are a great way for users who {"aren't"}{' '}
      running their own IPFS nodes to retrieve content from the IPFS network.
      However, they do introduce a centralized point of failure to a user flow.
      If a given gateway is down, or is under too much load, or is facing other
      issues, users who are accessing content through that gateway might be
      unable to access content. In this case, we recommend trying another
      gateway or running and using your own IPFS node.
      <br />
      <br />
      Additionally, if the data was not stored on NFT.Storage, then there might
      be issues with the IPFS node(s) with a copy of the data providing that
      data to the gateway. Using NFT.Storage makes sure that the content stored
      is broadcasted to the network using best practices!

      Filecoin storage providers commit their hard drive capacity to the
      Filecoin network, and earn significant block rewards for doing so. This
      translates into real-world profits for storage providers, which
      incentivizes them to continue committing additional hard disk space to the
      Filecoin network. However, when storage providers are storing data from
      Filecoin users, their likelihood of winning block rewards goes up by a big
      factor ä¸€ <strong>10x</strong>! Because NFT.Storage participates in

      program, all data uploaded through the service is eligible for this 10x
      reward multiplier. This is such a powerful incentive for Filecoin storage
      providers to store user data that they tend to be willing to offer free
      storage and retrieval services in order to get this block reward multiple.
      As a result, most storage providers offer free storage and retrieval on
      Filecoin today and will continue to do so as long as block rewards
      continue to be a powerful incentive. This should be true for a very long
      time ä¸€ for example, it is still the case that block rewards are powerful
      incentives for Bitcoin miners today. While there is some additional

      It depends. If you&#39;re using <InlineCode>storeDirectory</InlineCode>{' '}
      from the JS library (i.e. sending a multipart HTTP request) then the
      request will be limited by 100MB so you&#39;ll only be able to send as
      many files as can fit in that limit. This will be fixed in the future (

      IPFS node to create a directory that is bigger than the maximum block size
      that libp2p is willing to transfer (although it&#39;s not clear if that is
      even possible within the 100MB request limit). This could happen because
      go-ipfs doesn&#39;t currently shard directories (but this is planned by
      default for v0.11). If you use the <InlineCode>storeCar</InlineCode>{' '}
